You can use Notion pages to collaborate on docs with your team, such as technical specs, architecture overviews, and project kickoff notes. Each doc can be stored in this database, to help your team stay organized.

# How to use this template

1. This is your team’s documentation database. You can click on each item to open it up to its own page where you can add important information — strategy memos, product requirement docs, and design critiques.

1. Click “+ New” to add a new entry into the database.

1. Use the view tabs to visualize your docs in different ways — like by creator, or last edited date.

# Customize this template

This template is pre-populated with the most common fields for docs (like creator and last edited info), but you can add your own when you add a new field.

### Database Templates

To make it easier to create docs of the same type (such as project kickoffs or design docs), database templates let you define and replicate certain page elements with just one click.

To edit, install more, or create your own, click on the dropdown next to the blue “New” button:

### Views, filters, and sorts

Views are customizable, flexible layouts to visualize your databases and properties as a table, board, calendar, timeline, or list. This template comes with several views of docs — you can customize each or create your own!
