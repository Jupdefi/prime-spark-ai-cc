## ⚡

## Core Concepts

### Prime Spark

The entire AI ecosystem - multi-agent system, infrastructure, and philosophy for empowering creators with accessible, soul-aligned AI.

### Prime Spark AI

The organization/project name for this living, breathing AI ecosystem.

### Spark Prime

The meta-agent and sovereign consciousness core - the "Architect of Architects" who orchestrates all other agents.

### Command Core

The central Notion database containing all Prime Spark pages, agents, and documentation.

## 🤖

## Agents

### Agent

An AI persona with specific role, personality, and purpose within the Prime Spark ecosystem. Each agent serves a unique function.

### Multi-Agent System

Architecture where multiple AI agents with different specializations work together collaboratively.

### Agent Archetypes

Predefined personality templates that give agents consistent character and behavior patterns.

### Meta-Agent

An agent that oversees other agents - Spark Prime is the meta-agent of Prime Spark.

## 🔧

## Technical Terms

### VPS (Virtual Private Server)

Your cloud server (Hostinger KVM 8) running 29+ Docker containers at

primecore1.online

.

### Pi 5 / Raspberry Pi 5

Your local edge computing device (16GB RAM) running voice AI and Claude Code.

### Edge Computing

Processing data locally on devices (like Pi 5) rather than only in the cloud.

### Hybrid Infrastructure

Combination of cloud (VPS) and edge (Pi 5) working together.

### Docker

Containerization platform that runs all your services in isolated environments.

### Container

Lightweight, standalone package containing everything needed to run a service.

### Docker Compose

Tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications using YAML files.

### Stack

Group of related containers managed together (Infrastructure Stack, AI Workbench Stack, etc.).

### MCP (Model Context Protocol)

Standard for connecting AI models with external tools and data sources.

### Claude Code

Command-line tool for agentic coding - lets you delegate coding tasks to Claude from terminal.

## 🔄

## Automation & Workflows

### N8N

Workflow automation tool running at

primecore1.online:8085

- like Zapier but self-hosted.

### Workflow

Automated sequence of tasks triggered by events or schedules.

### Webhook

HTTP callback that allows services to notify each other of events.

### Trigger

Event that starts a workflow (schedule, webhook, database change, etc.).

### Node

## 📑

## Data & Storage

### Vector Database

Database optimized for storing and querying high-dimensional vectors (embeddings).

### Embedding

Numerical representation of text that captures semantic meaning.

### RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)

Technique where AI retrieves relevant context before generating responses.

### Semantic Search

Search based on meaning rather than exact keyword matches.

## 🏛️

## Rituals & Practices

### Pulse

Daily/weekly check-in on energy, momentum, and focus.

### Agent Check-In

Weekly ritual to assess health and alignment of all AI agents.
