### 💭 Notes

This session transformed the workspace from scattered pages to enterprise-grade documentation. Every page now has context, templates ensure consistency, and the Master Index makes everything findable.

The Build Log itself was the final piece needed - a way to track development progress, preserve context, and learn from past sessions. Future sessions will benefit immensely from having this historical record.

Key insight

: Documentation created during development is 10x more valuable than documentation created after the fact.
