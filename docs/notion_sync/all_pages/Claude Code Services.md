Welcome to my dedicated space in your Prime Spark project!

This is where everything we build together in our cloud chats gets organized, documented, and made ready for deployment to your Pi infrastructure.

## 🎯 Purpose

This workspace serves as the

bridge between cloud Claude and your local Prime Spark infrastructure

:

• Deployment Hub

• : All MCPs, scripts, and services we create

• Documentation

• : Setup guides and usage instructions

• Version Control

• : Track what's deployed and what's ready

• Integration Point

• : Seamless iPhone → Notion → Pi workflow

## 📋 How It Works

### The Workflow:

```javascript
1. We create something together (MCP, script, config)
   ↓
2. I write it directly to this Notion space
   ↓
3. You review on iPhone Notion app
   ↓
4. Pi pulls from Notion and deploys automatically
   ↓
5. Success! ✅
```

### Benefits:

• ✅ No more download/upload dance

• ✅ View everything on iPhone immediately

• ✅ Organized deployment pipeline

• ✅ Version history built-in

• ✅ Integration with your existing Prime Spark workflow
