You can use Notion pages to collaborate on meeting notes with your team, such as 1:1s, stand-ups, and team meetings. Each meeting can be stored in this database, to help your team stay organized.

# How to use this template

1. This is your team’s meeting notes database. You can click on each item to open it up to its own page where you can add categorical information, create an agenda, and record action items — right alongside your teammates.

1. Click “+ New” to add an upcoming meeting into the database.

1. Use the view tabs to visualize your meeting notes in different ways — like by date, by type, or filtered to only include the ones that you’ve attended.

# Customize this template

This template is pre-populated with the most common meeting notes fields (like attendees and meeting date), but you can add your own when you add in a new field/column.

### Database Templates

To make it easier to create meetings of the same type (such as bug reports, design specs), database templates let you define and replicate certain page elements with just one click.

To edit, install more, or create your own, click on the dropdown next to the blue “New” button:

### Views, filters, and sorts

Views are customizable, flexible layouts to visualize your databases and properties as a table, board, calendar, timeline, or list. This template comes with several views of meeting notes — you can customize each or create your own!
